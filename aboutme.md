## General Information
My name is Ilya S. Dementyev. I am a computational chemist, with an Honours BSc. in Bio-Organic Chemistry from McGill University.
In September 2022, I will be working and studying at University of Ottawa as a full-time Master's student in computational enzyme design. 

## Starting Out
Ever since late high school, I was fascinated by organic chemistry, and its ability to create complex materials beneficial for humanity. 
It was only in my first year of university that I realized I liked chemical catalysis more, due to my enjoyment of its optimization and physics principles.
Hence, I started delving deeper into inorganic chemistry and catalysis.
However, I discovered in the following summer that inorganic catalysts, while extremely useful, are very hazardous and unfriendly to the environment. 
Therefore, I started investigating more benign but efficient catalysts which resulted in high yields with high stereoselectivity: enzymes.

## Developing Interest in Computational Approaches
During my second summer, I did a research project involving computational simulations and modelling of 8-oxoguanine within dsDNA using PLUMED-patched GROMACS to model the energy landscape of geometric rotations involving the base using metadynamics. Ever since then, I appreciated the power of computers, especially HPC hardware like GPUs. Ever since then, I have enjoyed utilizing computational approaches to solving life science questions, especially for protein design. 

## The Modern Day
To this day, I am endlessly fascinated by interdisciplinary approaches to science. I believe today's issues are more complex than ever, and using every field of knowledge to our advantage is how we will move forward.

## Other Interests
I am currently using my knowledge of C++ and Unreal Engine to create [pmUE](https://github.com/ISDementyev/pmUE), a molecular visualization plugin for Unreal Engine 4, as well as an RPG video game using Gaea for landscape design.
